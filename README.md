Why
===
1. We are required to have a repository for our game. Github fullfils that requirement.
2. Quick and simple to get working! Also can be put on resume and is a form of source control.

How To
=====

How to Github!
--------------

First install git! https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git
Do the install and brief setup. There is also an app but loses some functionality. You can use either.

Now once you setup git it's very simple to use.
1. Create a folder anywhere on your computer for the project.

2. Hold shift and right click the folder and select "Open Command Window Here"

3. Type "git init" in the command prompt

4. Type "git remote add origin https://github.com/Cryton/Studio-Capstone.git"

5. Type "git pull origin master"

6. You should now see this README.md along with the Design doc in the folder. Once we create the project
we will put it in here and can push/pull to this repo.

Push/Pulling your data
----------------------
1. Hold shift and right click the folder and select "Open Command Window Here"
2. First do a "git pull origin master" to pull down any new changes. If you get Merge conflicts open up the
appropriate files and fix the conflicts. (Highlighted by ============== in the code files.)
3. Now to add files. To add a specific files do "git add (filename here)". To add all changes files do "git add -A"
4. Next commit your files using "git commit -m "Description here""
5. Finally do "git push -u origin master"



That's the basic of Github! Ask me if somethings doesn't make sense.
